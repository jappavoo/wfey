* ToDo List
** DONE Find the number of sockets & Num sockets per core
** DONE Have macro that you can switch on/off based on numa node splitting
** DONE Change all macros hardcoded for numa nodes
** DONE Make sure scripts work with new updates
** TODO Allow for multiple event processors
*** This should be done in a separate branch!!
** DONE Error checking number of cores being used
- This can be done by looping back to the start but I will do that when multiple threads should run on same core
- In the meantime -- error out saying we are overloading the cpus
** DONE FIX 'num_event_cpus'
** TODO Possible wiki needs to be added to say how everything works

* Ideas
** Meta scripts?
- Should the scripts that run the experiment and the control thread of the benchmark still be separted to another socket?
  - I don't believe this should effect latency in any way -- should just control the noise
** Ids?
- Ids are currently not correlated to the core the event processors/generator runs on
- Idle threads do not have id's  -- not sure if this is something that we wish to have
